I am Alejandro Weinstein. I am a professor at the school of `Biomedical
Engineering <http://www.biomedica.uv.cl/>`_ in the `University of Valparaiso
<http://www.uv.cl>`_.  I did my PhD studies at the EECS department at the
Colorado School of Mines under the supervision of `Dr. Kevin Moore
<http://inside.mines.edu/~kmoore/>`_ and `Dr. Michael Wakin
<http://inside.mines.edu/~mwakin>`_. Currently, I am working on signal
processing of biomedical signals using sparse models and representations. I am
also interested on bioinstrumentation and embedded systems.
